# decentralized_health_insurance_claiming

Decentralized Insurance Claiming on Blockchain
This project aims to demonstrate a decentralized insurance claiming system using the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages Solidity for smart contract development, React for the user interface, Truffle for development and testing, and Infura for Ethereum network connectivity.

Decentralized Insurance Claiming

Features
Smart contract for managing insurance policies and claims.
Decentralized verification and approval process for claims.
User-friendly web interface for interacting with the insurance system.
Technologies Used
Solidity: Smart contract language for Ethereum blockchain.
React: User interface development.
Truffle: Development, testing, and deployment framework for Ethereum.
Infura: Ethereum network API for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.
